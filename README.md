# Makeover Monday (MoM) - Week 30
**Political Representation of Women Worldwide**

## MoM Background
Makeover Monday is a weekly learning and development opportunity to work with a given data set and create better, more effective visualizations.  The goal with MoM is to make information more accessible, and participants are from around the world.  MoM is sponsored by Tableau.  Each week, sponsors post a visualization to be improved, along with a dataset for the original visualization.  Participants then make and share their vizs and the community gets smarter and more creative as a whole!

## Source Article and Viz
This week's Viz: Week 30 brings [a viz](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w30/workspace/file?filename=FEMALE+POLITICAL+REPRESENTATION+WORLDWIDE.png) about women's global representation in power, and needs a little work!

## Data Source
Data is from the World Bank and available [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.GEN.PARL.ZS).

## My Approach for Week 30
The original viz has 3 total visuals, 2 maps, and 1 heatmap.  The visuals are very busy (using labels inappropriately) and the diverging color scheme is confusing.  I aim to fix these components of the visual, but otherwise stick with the maps and heatmap.
